All  companies  are  transformed  into \ninformation-based operations  through online  technologies.  The pace  of technical transition is so \nexponential  that  modern  electronic  commerce  is  now  making  significant  shifts  in  the  economic \nenvironment, impacting all areas of industry. The Web has expanded companies' scope. The vast \nquantity  of  business  information  made  accessible  by  the  global  network  that  facilitates  the \ngathering  of  information  between  firms,  a  corporation,  its  clients  and  the  various  divisions  of  a \nbusiness is increasing exponentially. The information-based virtual value chains for any company \ncannot  be  overlooked  operationally  or  strategically.  This  review  article  discussed  the  aspects  of \nelectronic  commerce  including  its  importance,  facilitators,  benefits,  challenges  and  scope  in  the \nIndian market.  \n\nKeywords: Business, Consumer, Electronic commerce, Internet, Market strategy, Growth, Profit. \n\nINTRODUCTION \nGlobalization  as  well  as  information  technology  (IT) change  the  method of  the  business  doing  by  the \norganizations. In almost all companies that have invested largely in the IT infrastructure for the ultimate growth \nof their company, the IT system is implemented and integrated. The utilization of e-commerce (EC) as a way to \nexecute  transactions  related  to  business  is  increasing  concern.  It  has  been  a  priority  for  many  companies  [1]. \nWith EC, businesses will link \"Just in Time production\" and \"Just in Time\" to their trading partners, who boost \ntheir strategic abilities worldwide. EC's description is not widely agreed upon. From the communications point \nof view, EC may represent information, services as well products  or online payments through telephone lines, \ncomputer  networking,  or  other  means  from  a  communication  point  of  view.  EC  implements  technology  for \nautomating  corporate  transactions  and  workflows  from  a  business  process  perspective.  From  a  service \nviewpoint,  EC  is  a  way  of  lowering  services  costs  while  enhancing  product  efficiency  and  speeding  up  the \ndelivery of services, which addresses industry, customers and management's desire. EC offers online shopping \nand distributing goods and information for the Internet and other online resources from an online point of view. \nBecause of Internet and network technology's popularity and accelerated expansion,  the electronic industry has \nbecome a significant field for contemporary enterprises. Large company operations are being carried out online \ntoday.  People  sell  and  purchase  products  and  services  online,  and  without  internet  infrastructure,  certain \npurchases cannot be done [2]. \nThis review article provides an overview of electronic commerce, mainly focused on its definition and why it is \nimportant for  the  modern  market. It also discussed the different types of electronic commerce fields and  their \nfacilitators.  Apart  from  the  benefits  offering  by  e-commerce,  there  are  some  disadvantages  also  that  will  be \ndiscussed in the subsequent sections. The last sections will discuss the trend and future of electronic commerce \nin India. \n\nE-Commerce and Its Importance \nE-commerce  is  referred  to  as electronic commerce. It  means  the  electronic  media and the internet  for dealing \nwith  goods  and  services.  E-Commerce  entails  a  company  accessing  the  internet  as  well  as  IT,  such  as  the \nelectronic data interchange (EDI). E-commerce concerns an internet vendor's website, trading goods or services \nto the user directly from the platform. The gateway uses a wireless purchase cart or a purchase basket to pay by \ncredit  card,  debit  card  or  Electronic  fund  transfer (EFT).  A  further  description  is  as  follows:  Electronic \ncommunications  and  digital  information  processes  in  business  transactions  are  used  to  create,  modify  and \nredefine value generation relations between, and between, organizations and individuals [3].  \nWith the increasing spread of ICTs, specifically the Internet, the global corporate world pushes rapidly into e-\ncommerce  (Business-to-Business).  As  the  Internet  enables  consumers  to  enter  the  global  economy,  they  can \ncompare prices across areas, find out how they vary by request, and become aware of substitution. The buyers \nobtain  a  distinct  advantage.  Thanks  to  market  openness,  consumers  can  conveniently  compare  e-commerce \nofferings  from  different  websites.  The  rivals  would  immediately  be  one  click  away  from  the  customer  if  the \ncompany is electronic. If consumers aren't comfortable with certain e-goods, content's pricing or services, they \n\nCopyright  \u00a9  The  Author(S)  2021.  Published  By  Society  Of  Business  And  Management.

They don't need a physical store from the point of view \nof the vendors [4]. \n\nE-Commerce Facilitators \n1. Internet: \nE-commerce has grown through huge penetration of the internet. The Internet and intelligent mobile telephones \nhave  literally  been  part  of  every  life.  Internet  no  longer  constitutes  an  intelligence  source,  however,  it  is  an \nefficient  means  in  which  horsemen,  and  carpenters,  physicians  etc.  can  buy,  read,  communicate  and  even \nreceive service. The supply chain is slender and intelligent, as digital networks can quickly link to customers, \nwhich  greatly  minimizes  pollution  and  benefits  green  businesses.  In  the  last  15  years,  the  ICT  revolution  has \npowered the economy unprecedentedly. The Internet and its services have helped grow new markets with huge \ntechnological advancements. In the 1980s the population of internet users was small, and there was a gradual but \nsteady increase until 1994 when the number of test users was growing. The number of network users exploded \nwith the advent of the World Wide Web and later the expansion of multimedia content. The internet has in turn \nevolved  even  quicker  than  any  other  previous  medium.  The  United  Nations  International  Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) recently forecast 3.2 billion users online in 2015. There were 7.2 billion inhabitants in May 2015. \nIn 2000, worldwide Internet subscribers were just 400 million. \n2. Payment Gateway: \nThe  payment  transfer,  which  allows  e-commerce,  online  shops,  bricks,  and  clicks  and  traditional  brick  and \nmortar payments  via credit card, is an ecommerce application service  provider service.  The  main variables in \ninternet  transactions  are  payment  routes  that  include  credit  cards,  debit  cards,  online  banking  purchases,  and \ntransfers  of  electronic  funds.  There  is  a  need  for  payment  gates  for  sustainable  future  e-Commerce,  and  the \nenvironment shifts from cash into digital currency. \n3. Analytics: \nAnalytics  is  the  empirical  way  of  transforming  data  into  decision-making  intelligence.  Analytics  assists \norganizations in collecting, arranging, reviewing and commenting on their clients. The vast rise in data volume \nhas  caused  organizations  to  rely  on  research  to  know  the  customer's  behavior.  Retailers  must  have  real-time \naccess  to  knowledge  to  compute  returns  on  internet  investments  and  a  channel  blend.  Basic  analytics  are \navailable  for  e-commerce  players;  for  customer  insight,  average  order  volume,  basket  size  measuring, \nconversion ratios are required and a deeper analytical approach is needed. \n4. Social Media: \nTo  advertise  their  goods,  businesses  constantly  use  social  media.  Social  media  involves  blogs  and  computer \napplications  that  allow  the  use  of  the  computer  or  cell  phone  for  connection  and  exchanging  the  information \nthrough  the  internet.  Social  networking  is  more  critical  in  the  creation  of  products  and  reminds  clients  of \ndifferent  deals.  The  input  on  the  product  or  the  service  is  also  useful.  It  provides  a  brand-building  tool  for \ncreating a trustworthy group of consumers, publications, word of mouth and so on. \n5. Autonomous Vehicles: \nAutonomous cars are belongs to the  motor vehicles category that can work without direct intervention from a \nhuman operator using artificial intelligence, sensors and the global system of positioning. The age of the private \ncar  is  quickly  approaching.  Autonomous  consumers  will  have  much  time  to  browse  the  internet,  read  emails, \npurchase new items and view commercials nearby. Very vast digital media expertise is obtained for autonomous \nvehicles.  These  shopping  and  search  trends  can  be  traced  to  assist  businesses  in  tailoring  their  marketing \nstrategy to avoid this new industry. Big data are now much wider in nature but in  the coming years will be so \nadapted and predictive that nothing can be manually modified again. \n6. 3D Printing: \n3D printer belongs to an electronic device category that can build a digital 3-dimensional model. The \"additive \nmanufacturing\" technique is an overlay that resembles the successful laying of the colors of an ink-jet printer on \na  flat  sheet  of  paper.  3D  printing  might  one  day  blow  out  the  method  of  output  people use,  as  the  Industrial \nRevolution in starting of 19th century shook agricultural life. 3D printing produces business of prototypes that \nthe  consumer  is  expected  to  print  \u2014  or  that  the  designer  is  connected  to  a  third-party  maker.  The  finished \nproduct is not marketed \u2013 the concept is sold and a printable license. In the corners of the internet, promising \nartists show their printing plans either at home or at work. \n\nE-Commerce Business Types \nThere are mainly six basic types of electronic commerce as shown in the Figure 1: \n\nJournal of Contemporary Issues in Business and Government | Vol 27, Issue 3, 2021                                 666 \n\n \n \n \n\fVipin Jain et al / An Overview of Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) \n\nFig.1: Schematic illustration of the Types of the E-commerce based on their Characteristics \n\n1. Business-to-Business (B2B): \nElectronic  commerce  B2B  includes  all  electronic  products  or  services  transfers  between  firms.  In  general \nproducers and traditional industrial wholesale companies use this approach for electronic trading. \n2. Business-to-Consumer (B2C): \nCompany  and  final  client  electronic  company  partnerships  E-commerce  business  to  consumer.  It  is  the  e-\ncommerce shopping section, where conventional retail business typically takes place.  These partnership styles \ncan  be  simpler,  more  complex  and  intermittent  and  can  be  discontinued.  This  business  type  has  expanded \nconsiderably  because  of  the  advent  of  the  Internet  with  a  number  of  online  shops  and  centers  that  offer \ncustomers'  products  of  any  kind  such  as  computers,  electronics,  books,  accessories,  cars,  food,  financial \nmaterials and digital publications. In contrast to retail sales in conventional trade, the buyer typically has more \nknowledge  about  insightful  content  available  and  it  is  generally  accepted  that  you  can  buy  cheaper,  without \njeopardizing a similarly individual customer experience as well as promising easy processing and distribution. \n3. Consumer-to-consumer (C2C): \nType C2C electronic e-commerce encompasses all trade in goods or services electronically between customers. \nTypically this exchange is done by a third party that offers an online transaction forum. \n4. Consumer-to-business (C2B): \nIn  C2B  is  reversed  the  usual  context  of  exchange  in  goods.  This  method  of  e-commerce  is  widely  used  in \ncrowdsourcing-based  companies.  For  companies  that  aim  precisely  at  some  types  of  services  or  items, \nindividuals  also  sell  their  services  or  products.  These  events  include  locations  at  which  artists  ask  for  several \nsuggestions  for  a  logo  and  only  one  is  successfully  selected  and  purchased.  Another  popular  medium  in  this \nbusiness segment is the markets which sell photos, photos, media and design elements free of royalty. \n5. Business-to-administration (B2A): \nThis  portion  comprises  all  internet  transactions  between  companies  and  the  government.  This  covers  a  wide \nvariety of diverse programs, notably in areas such as taxation, social care, healthcare, legal documentation and \nrecords,  etc.  These  modes  of  services  have  been  significantly  extended  in  recent  years  by  spending  in  e-\ngovernment. \n6. Consumer-to-administration (C2A): \nThe C2A model includes all electronic purchases between governments and individuals. Application highlights \ninclude: \n\uf0b7  Education \u2013 disseminating information, distance learning, etc. \n\uf0b7  Social Security \u2013 via information distribution, making payments, etc. \n\uf0b7  Taxes \u2013 filing tax returns, payments, etc. \n\uf0b7  Health \u2013 appointments, information about illnesses, payment of health services, etc \n\nE-Commerce Potential In The Modern Market \nWorld Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet have limited the number of trading places on the global economy. \nSouth Pacific nations have been closer to the  rest of the  world in terms of shorter trading cycles and lowered \ntransaction costs by accelerating the process of purchasing and exporting the goods. South Pacific countries will \ntheoretically have access to new markets. It poses real prospects for developing-country small businesses amid \n\nJournal of Contemporary Issues in Business and Government | Vol 27, Issue 3, 2021                                 667 \n\n \n \n \n\fVipin Jain et al / An Overview of Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) \n\nall of the hysteria surrounding electronic commerce and the recent collapse of several dot-com firms [5]. They \nmight  give  artisans  who  produce  such  things  as  tapa  clothes  the  opportunity  to  directly  sell  the  Internet  and \npresent  pictures  of  their  products  using  digital  cameras.  If  a  reduction  in  transaction  costs  produced  by  the \ninternet  is  adequate  to  promote  a  wide-ranging  shift  within  the  global  economy,  though  electronic  business \nseems to be highly promising for small-scale producers, who face problems entering foreign markets. \nThe new trend in the industry of e-commerce has now extended to many directions relative to how it began. The \ne-commerce  marketplace  today  is  no  longer  merely  an  online  forum  for  people  to  purchase  or  sell,  but  even \nmore  so,  as  e-commerce  has  increasingly  changed,  ranging  from  being  extremely  local,  infusing  artificial \nintelligence and providing even intangible products and services such as GST enforcement and short-term loans. \nWith  the  introduction  of  technologies  advancing  at  light  speed,  the  potential  view  of  the  consumer  is  on  the \nverge of full transition. However, it is sure to focus on consumer services enhanced across the Internet of Things \n(IoT),  processing  of  data,  logistics,  artificial  intelligence,  personalization  and  hyper-local  space  for  the  next \ngeneration of e-commerce patterns. Take a look into some of the stuff in e-commerce in existing and emerging \nmarkets and build traction in the coming years [6]. \n\nE-Commerce Benefits \nThe biggest advantage from the consumer viewpoint is that it improves dramatically and saves lots of time and \nconvenient to access from everywhere in the world. At any time, the customer is free to place the order [7]. For \nconsumers, the key advantages of e-commerce are: \n\uf0b7  Lower trade rates for stock exchange members. \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  The customer has better access by clicking on the button to search details on numerous pages, easily and \n\n Enhanced flexibility - purchases can be carried out 24 hours a day without physical contact with the firm. \n Save time - Consumers will at any time purchase or sell any product online. \n\ncontinuously accessing information. \n\n\uf0b7  Comfort in both purchases and transactions be made from the comfort that a buyer needs from a home or \n\noffice. \n\n\uf0b7  Moving to other companies-customers is still easy if the company's operation is unsatisfactory. \n\uf0b7  A  product  was  not  available  at  the  local  or  national  market  that  provides  consumer\u2019s  access  to  a  larger \n\nproduct than before could be available to customers. \n\n\uf0b7  A consumer will make feedback on a product to see what others buy or see other clients' review comments \n\nbefore making a final purchase. \n\nIt helps in revenue generation  \n\nIncreased  sales  and  decreased  running  and  sustaining  costs  through  the  Internet  are  the  key  advantage  of  e-\ncommerce from the point of view of sellers. Include the following: \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Reduces significantly costs related to operation as well as maintenance  \n\uf0b7  Reduces costs that is spend on purchase as well as procurement  \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Significantly reduction in budget spend transportation of the products  \n\uf0b7 \nImprove and develop relationship of customer and the supplier  \n\uf0b7 \nIt helps in speeding the selling process \n\uf0b7  Make  internal as well as external communication better   \n\uf0b7 \n\nIt helps to raise customer loyalty as well as retention \n\nIt promote the image of any company and brand  \n\nChallenges Associated with E-Commerce \nLike  other  technologies,  electronic  commerce  (E-commerce)  also  facing  many  challenges.  These  challenges \nmainly faced by the buyer as well as sellers  who use internet as a medium for the business. Some of the these \nchallenges are discussed as follows[8]: \n\uf0b7  The electronic commerce market is not rising along with private and public enterprises. Private and public \ncollaboration  is  needed  to  increase  the  electronic  commerce  industry.  Joint  efforts  offer  people  the \ncredibility they need to succeed on electronic commerce. \n\n\uf0b7  There  is  no  system  protection,  reliability,  special  requirements  and  some  communication  protocols.  The \ncustomer loses his money, if the e-commerce website is hacked. For e-commerce Web sites, cyber security \nis the most common problem. \n\n\uf0b7  Financial  institutions  and  intermediates:  So  far,  financial  institutions  and  banks  are  reluctant  to  play  an \nactive role in supporting the e-commerce market in developed countries. But retailers need the participation \nof banks in expanding e-scope commerce and popularity and in mitigating theft and possible losses related \nto credit card fraud. However, banks and other financial service intermediaries are threatened outside their \npayment  card  strategy,  in  areas  with  no  ordinary  credit  card  creation  alternative  approaches  to  safe  and \nefficient online purchases. \n\nJournal of Contemporary Issues in Business and Government | Vol 27, Issue 3, 2021                                 668 \n\n \n \n \n\fVipin Jain et al / An Overview of Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) \n\n\uf0b7  There is a culture of purchasing goods in developed countries by bargaining deals with suppliers, which is \n\nchallenging for e-commerce in developing nations due to the absence of facilities in the networks. \n\n\uf0b7  One of the biggest challenges is the reduction of internet prices. The regulators are trying to be modest in \nbandwidth  costs.  However,  the  internet  does  not  remain  low  due  to  high  network  delivery  and  servicing \ncosts. \n\n\uf0b7  The most critical factor is trust in electronic settlements. A standard paper on Baseline Laws and Rules may \nprovide  for  the  accuracy  and  legitimacy  of  e-commerce  transactions.  The  trust  in  the  developed  world  is \nbased  on  modern  legislation  and  impartiality  in  electronic  transactions.  Although  the  legislation  and  the \njudicial  system  which  does  not  establish  e-commerce-based  transactions  are  not  covered,  whether  real  or \nperceived, they are adverse.  In  many developed nations, cash delivery is  still today the  most  well-known \nprocess, with checks and credit cards not being readily accepted. \n\n\uf0b7  For  modern  transaction  procedures,  new  instruments  and  new  service  providers  the  legal  description, \nconsent and authorization are needed. For example, it is important to define an electronic signature and the \nstatus of a handwritten signature. The new legislative definitions and permits as the legal term of a bank and \nthe notion of a domestic border can also be reviewed. \n\nBesides  the  above  challenges,  the  emerging  economy  of  some  developing  countries  also  faced  many  other \nchallenges are discussed below:  \n\uf0b7  Lacking in education  \n\uf0b7  Diverse Cultural and tradition  \n\uf0b7  Poor framework related to online marketing  \n\uf0b7  Less marketing and promotion  \n\uf0b7  Political issues \n\uf0b7  High cost of services and products as compared to traditional market  \n\uf0b7  Less coverage of internet  \n\uf0b7  Communication is disorganized across the country  \n\uf0b7  Less number of trustable business as well as enterprise and  \n\uf0b7  Direct meeting with seller and buyer  is missing \n\nE-Commerce Trends in India \nThe purchasing of products and services through e-commerce enables shoppers to select when and where to buy \nand to study the commodity, the vendor and other choices available. The availability of online information has \nrevolutionized the buying process. Almost anything that can be purchased in a shop, including perishable items \nsuch  as  food,  can  be  purchased  through  e-commerce.  And  customers  around  the  world  have  taken  up  these \nopportunities. In all spheres of industry, from services provides to the customer to the design of the new product, \nthe  influence  of  e-commerce  already  exists  [9].  It  offers  new  forms  of  company  knowledge  to  meet  and \ncommunicate  with  consumers,  such  as  internet  advertisement  and  commercialization,  order  fulfillment  online \nand  customer  support  online.  At  least  a  phase  in  the  purchase  life  of  the  WWW  is  still  being  used  for  e-\ncommerce.  It  may  also  minimize  costs  of  order  processing  and  communicate  with  a  large  number  of  vendors \nand  trade  partners,  which  generally  bring  substantial  overheads  to  product  and  service  costs.  E-commerce \nprovides  tremendous  opportunities  for  emerging  countries  such  as  India.  It  is  still  in  its  infancy  in  India,  but \neven the most negative forecasts suggest a boom. In recent years, it has been noticed growth in the multiple of \nelectronic  commerce  organizations.  Instead  of  advertisement  sales,  big  Indian  websites  have  pushed  into  e-\ncommerce.  \nThere are number of services and products such from flowers, greeting cards, multiplex tickets to grocery shops, \nmobile  devices,  machines  etc.  are  now  available  in  several  locations.  Electronic  commerce  has  expanded  it\u2019s \nreached  the  stage  to  even  sell  the  dung  patties  of  cow  like  hotcakes.  In  2016,  the  Indian  market  in  electronic \ncommerce is supposed to hit a $38 billion level, a huge leap over the Industry's $23 billion in sales in 2015, a \nstudy by Assocham said [10]. Increased internet and smartphone usage, increased adoption of online purchases \nand optimistic demographics have given businesses with a rare ability to contact their clients. On the other hand, \nas  a  healthy  and  secure  companion  to  electronic  commerce,  mobile  commerce  (m-commerce)  has  evolved \nrapidly. Online shopping via smartphones is a game-changer. M-commerce is expected to add up to 70% of its \noverall sales. \n\nCONCLUSION \nIn summary, in the years to come, the industry of electronic commerce will be a one of the leading sector in the \nfield of electronic business. The revolution in electronic commerce has huge positive impact on the transaction \nindustry by fast offering new markets and crossing edges. It greatly affected the conventional market system in \nthe  world and  made  it  possible  to  improve  the  lives  of  people.  Although  it  provides  customers  and  sellers \nrewards, e-commerce poses conventional businesses with obstacles to a sustainable place. Developing countries \n\nJournal of Contemporary Issues in Business and Government | Vol 27, Issue 3, 2021                                 669 \n\n \n \n \n\fVipin Jain et al / An Overview of Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) \n\npose  a  range  of  challenges  to  the  effective  conduct  of  e-commerce  when  contrasting  it  with  developing \ncountries. When Internet prices are minimal, e-commerce flourishes quickly and many companies are typically \ndrained. Convenience is one of the major advantages of electronic commerce for consumers and thus increasing \ncustomer  loyalty.  This  is  because  consumers  can  put  orders  via  internet  access  from  anywhere  they  are. \nCompany e-commerce offering a seamless operation and  multiple payment choices should be essential to any \ncustomer  and  provide  more  functions  accessible  online.  Other  advantages  include  expanded  products  and \nenhanced regional coverage. However, e-commerce companies face many challenges in their expansion. \n\nREFERENCES \n1.  R.  E.
